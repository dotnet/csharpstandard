This specification replaces ECMA-334:2022. Changes from the previous edition include the addition of the following:

- Binary integer literals
- Embedded digit separators in numeric literals
- Leading-digit separators in binary and hexadecimal integer literals
- `out` variables
- Discards
- Tuple types
- Pattern Matching
- `ref` locals and returns, conditional `ref` expressions, `ref` with `this` in extension methods, and reassignment of `ref` local variables
- Local Functions
- More expression-bodied members
- `throw` Expressions
- Generalized `async` return types
- `async Main` method
- `default` literal expressions
- Non-trailing named arguments
- `private protected` access modifier
- `in` parameter modifier
- `readonly` structs
- `ref` structs
- Indexing movable fixed buffer without pinning
- Initializers on `stackalloc` arrays
- Pattern-based `fixed` statements
- `System.Delegate` and `System.Enum` as *class_type* constraints.
- Additional generic constraints
- Allow expression variables in more locations
- Attach attributes to the backing field of auto-implemented properties
- Reduce ambiguity of overload resolution
