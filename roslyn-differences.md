# Inconsistencies between Roslyn and the C# standard

As noted in the [README](README.md), although the C# compiler within [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) is the closest compiler we have to a reference implementation, there are areas where its behavior is inconsistent with the standard. This document lists those inconsistencies where they are known, organized by standard section.

TODO: There was talk of a document in the Roslyn repo which mentioned this, but I can't find it.

TODO: How do we keep section references in sync? Will we need to update the section renumbering code? What about quoted text? (Periodically just check it?)

# Conversions

## Implicit enum conversions from zero

From [ยง10.2.4](standard/conversions.md#1024-implicit-enumeration-conversions):

> An implicit enumeration conversion permits a *constant_expression* ([ยง11.21](standard/expressions.md#1121-constant-expressions)) with any integer type and the value zero to be converted to any *enum_type* and to any *nullable_value_type* whose underlying type is an *enum_type*.

Roslyn performs implicit enumeration conversions from constant expressions with types of `float`, `double` and `decimal` as well:

```csharp
enum SampleEnum
{
    Zero = 0,
    One = 1
}

class EnumConversionTest
{
    const float ConstFloat = 0f;
    const double ConstDouble = 0d;
    const decimal ConstDecimal = 0m;

    static void PermittedConversions()
    {
        SampleEnum floatToEnum = ConstFloat;
        SampleEnum doubleToEnum = ConstDouble;
        SampleEnum decimalToEnum = ConstDecimal;
    }
}
```

Conversions are (correctly) *not* permitted from constant expressions which have a type of `bool`, other enumerations, or reference types.
